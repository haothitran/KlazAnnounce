# KlazAnnounce

A World of Warcraft add-on that displays chat text indicators for when important friendly spells and abilities are used in an instance while player is in a party or raid environment. Includes tooltip link for these spells and abilities to easily access information about them rather than having to resort to referencing the in-game spellbook or external sources.

There are no in-game options. Settings are hard-coded and can be changed by accessing the file `Config.lua` and editing values.

## Installation

1. Backup `World of Warcraft\Interface` and `World of Warcraft\WTF` folders. Just in case.
2. Download and extract folder.
3. Place extracted folder in `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\` directory.
4. Restart World of Warcraft client.
